# eCommerce Web Application

The project involves creating an interactive eCommerce platform that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products seamlessly. The platform fetches product data from an API, and displays key information such as product title, price, and ratings. The site features live search functionality that filters products in real-time as users type, along with product categorization. To enhance the user experience, the platform includes a dark mode toggle, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.
